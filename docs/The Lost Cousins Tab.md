<p><strong>The Lost Cousins tab</strong> shows you people you have found on a census but have yet to enter onto Lost Cousins. Note this uses a Custom Fact called &quot;Lost Cousins&quot; which you will need to add to your FHP and record against those you have entered
 at the <a href="http://www.lostcousins.com/" target="_blank">Lost Cousins Website</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For creating Custom Facts, please see the section in the documentation &quot;<strong style="color:#253340; font-size:12.800000190734863px; font-family:'Segoe UI',Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; background-color:transparent">Using FTAnalyzer with popular Family
 History Programs&quot;</strong> and then choose&nbsp;the Family History Program.</p>
<p>This report will then show you a list of people that you have entered for that census year but have not recorded a Lost Cousins Fact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NB. by default it only lists direct ancestors, blood relatives and those married to directs or blood. Tick the other filter boxes to show other relationships.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The idea of the Lost Cousins tab report is essentially that it should always be blank indicating that everyone for whom you have a census entry is already tagged as entered into the Lost Cousins website.&nbsp;</p>
