<h3>New Step by Step Guide Available</h3>
<p>Part I of the new Family Tree Analyzer guide is now available <a href="http://download-codeplex.sec.s-msft.com/Download?ProjectName=ftanalyzer&DownloadId=848176">
to download</a></p>
<h3>Installing the software</h3>
<p>Installation is simple - Click on the download button on the <a href="http://ftanalyzer,codeplex.com" target="_self">
home page</a>&nbsp;this will download a very small file (if you are using a browser other than Internet Explorer you may need to tell the browser to run the file).</p>
<p>It will then present you with a screen offering to install the application. Clicking Install will install the program and create a shortcut for you. New updates should be installed automatically every time you start the program, so you'll always be up to
 date and won't have to check for updates.</p>
<p>If you get an error on install it is usually because you don't have the Microsoft .Net 4 Framework installed. This is usually the case on Windows 8 where the often .Net 4.5 is installed instead. In order for the program to be compatible with the older Windows
 7 I chose to use .Net 4.0 as this works on both and on XP.</p>
<p>If you are missing Microsoft .Net 4.0 Client Profile&nbsp;it can be downloaded&nbsp;free from Microsoft at<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=24872">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=24872</a>&nbsp;and clicking
 the download link. Once downloaded simply run the file to install.</p>
