<h3>New Step by Step Guide Available</h3>
<p>Part I of the new Family Tree Analyzer guide is now available <a href="http://download-codeplex.sec.s-msft.com/Download?ProjectName=ftanalyzer&DownloadId=848176">
to download</a></p>
<h3>Installing the software</h3>
<p>Installation is simple - Visit the <a href="http://ftanalyzer.com/install" target="_self">Install site</a>&nbsp;this will download a very small file (if you are using a browser other than Internet Explorer you may need to tell the browser to run the file).</p>
<p>It will then present you with a screen offering to install the application. Clicking Install will install the program and create a shortcut for you. New updates should be installed automatically every time you start the program, so you'll always be up to
 date and won't have to check for updates.</p>
<p>If you get an error on install it is usually because you don't have the Microsoft .Net 4.6 Framework installed. This is a version of the Microsoft coding framework installed on Windows from Vista SP2 through to Windows 10 and should be present if you regularly run Windows Updates (if not why on earth not? You are puting your machine and your data at extreme risk of compromise by not keeping it secure).</p>
<p>If you are missing Microsoft .Net 4.6&nbsp;it can be downloaded&nbsp;free from Microsoft at<a https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=48130">https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=48130</a>&nbsp;and clicking
 the download link. Once downloaded simply run the file to install.</p>
