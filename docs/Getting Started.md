<p>So, you've clicked on the download link and FTAnalyzer has been installed, but what next?<br>
<br>
The first thing you need to do is to open your Family Tree data. Your family tree data will be a file with an extension of .ged &nbsp;This type of file is called a GEDCOM file and is an industry standard method of exchanging family tree data between different
 software programs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The default file output from Family Tree software is not gedcom, but all&nbsp;Family Tree programs can export and import gedcom files.</p>
<p>Creating a gedcom file for your Family Tree software is covered in the section&nbsp;<strong><a href="/documentation.md" target="_blank">Using FTAnalyzer with popular Family History Programs</a></strong></p>
<p>Click on the File in the top left hand cornet of FTAnalyzer and click on Open. &nbsp;Navigate to where you have saved your gedcom file. &nbsp;Highlight the file name and click on open.</p>
<p>Data about the file and the records that are loading will appear in the bottom box. &nbsp;Some errors may also be displayed during the load operation, but don't worry! &nbsp;FTAnalyzer will help you fix those! &nbsp;At the end of the load, some statistics
 are displayed, number of Direct Ancestors, Blood relations etc.</p>
<p>After successfully loading, a message box will pop up to tell you that the load has been completed.</p>
<p>Click OK to continue.</p>
<p>Now you can use the various reports to analyse the data in your Family Tree. &nbsp;These reports are covered in more detail in their own section in this
