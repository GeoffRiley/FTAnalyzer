<p>Here you can open your Gedcom file or reload it.</p>
<p>Printing is available here and this is also where you can exit the program.</p>
<p>From here you can also Back-up your Geocode Database.</p>
<p>Pressing the Back-up button brings up a screen asking for the location where you would like to save the file. The filename includes the date of the backup and is also saved as a .zip to reduce its size.</p>
<p>It's recommended that you back-up your database file fairly regularly, or after large amount of map location corrections.</p>
<p>Here you will also find a restore function. &nbsp;You can only restore <span style="text-decoration:underline">
before</span> opening a gedcom file.</p>
