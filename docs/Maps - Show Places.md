## Screen Layout
The screen is divided into three parts - top left a tree of the locations from your GEDCOM, top right a map focused to the location currently selected from the tree and in the lower portion of the screen the facts pertinent to the place selected.

You may have ignored the reminder "You have 99 places with no map location ..." or may hit the daily geocoding limit but couldn't resist looking at this "Places" page.
