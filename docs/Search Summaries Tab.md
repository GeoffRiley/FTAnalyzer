<p>There are 2 reports that you can run from here, Colour BMD Report and Colour Census Report.</p>
<p>For both reports, there are filters so that you can search each type of ancestor separately, or in any combination.</p>
<p>There is a also a surname filter search box, which will then just show those surnames.</p>
<p>Its worth remembering that the 5 Relationship Type filters also work when searching by surname.</p>

<p><strong>The Colour BMD Report </strong></p>

<p><strong>The Colour Census Report </strong></p>
<p>For each person in the report, FTAnalyzer visually shows you using colour, the status of the Census and Lost Cousins facts.</p>
<p>The colours have tooltips which are available when you hover over a colour but are basically :</p>
<table border="0" width="696" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="2">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="111"><span style="color:#ff0000">Red</span></td>
<td valign="top" width="568">No Census information recorded</td>

<td valign="top" width="111"><span style="color:#008000">Green</span></td>
<td valign="top" width="568">Census information recorded</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="111"><span style="color:#800000">orange</span></td>
<td valign="top" width="568">Lost Cousins fact has been recorded but no census information recorded</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="111">Dark Grey</td>
<td valign="top" width="568">Not Alive in that year or outside of the UK</td>

<td valign="top" width="111"><span style="color:#ffff00">Yellow</span>&nbsp;</td>
<td valign="top" width="568">Census information recorded but No Lost Cousins Fact recorded</td>

<p>The report should make it easy at a glance to see who you have entered but not yet found on a census and who has been found but not yet tagged as entered onto Lost Cousins website.</p>
<p>In the example below on the 2nd line, you can see that censuses for 1881 through to 1911 have been entered, but a Lost Cousins Fact has not been recorded for 1881 and therefore shows as yellow.&nbsp; The green box for 1911 however means that the census data
 and a Lost Cousins Fact has been entered.</p>
