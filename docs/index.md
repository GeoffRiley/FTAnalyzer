<h3>Colour Census and Census Searching</h3>
<p>You can view the colour census report via the colour reports tab it lists everyone you choose to filter and shows the various UK census years. This list is then colour coded to show :</p>
<ul>
<li>grey - they weren't alive on that census </li><li><span style="color:#ff0000">red</span> - they were alive but you have yet to enter a CENSus or RESIdence fact for them.
</li><li><span style="color:#ffff00">yellow</span> - you have entered a census but you have not yet tagged the census as having been entered on the Lost Cousins website.
</li><li><span style="color:#00ff00">green</span> - you have entered a census and it isn't a Lost Cousins census year or is a Lost Cousins year and you have entered data on lost Cousins website.
</li><li><span style="color:#800000">orange</span> - you have added the details to Lost Cousins but not added the census data yet
</li></ul>
<p>The red and yellow boxes where there are missing census records are clickable. Select the website you want to search from the drop down box at the top of the report and then double click on a red box. This will then open up a search results page on Ancestry,
 FreeCen, FindMyPast or FamilySearch thus making it a quick and easy way to search the census records.</p>
<p>Similarly on the regular census reports clicking on the name of a person to find will try to look up that person on whichever site you have selected. Note you need to login to the site before clicking the person and have a subscription to use Ancestry or
 FindMyPast census searches.</p>
<h3><span style="font-size:1.17em">Notes</span></h3>
<p>All feedback welcome. Please note this is very much a work in progress, it works for my own Gedcom file however there is no guarantee that other ways of recording data will be consistently handled. If you wish to post error logs and log issues please include
 a sample gedcom file that demonstrates the problem you are having. I'd like to ensure that it works consistently for every user. Please also note that there is a bias in the program for UK searching as that is where my Ancestors are from. So some defaults
 may need to be tweaked or turned into user configurable options in later versions. Again let me know what works and what causes you problems.</p>
