<p><strong>The Individuals Tab</strong></p>
<p>This tab lists all the individuals that have been loaded from your GEDCOM file.</p>
<p>You can set the Root Person, ie: the person from whom all relationships are calculated, to anyone in this list by selecting a person, and then right clicking, and then select the option &quot;Set as Root Person&quot;.&nbsp;<span style="font-size:10pt">A small summary
 report is then shown to confirm the change and to display how many of what type of ancestors you have.</span></p>
<p>By clicking on any column title, you can sort on that column and clicking on the column heading again will change to a descending sort.</p>
<p>The Budgie Code is a method of defining relationships, and some further explanation on how the code works will be added here later.</p>
